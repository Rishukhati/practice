## Purpose

This repo is for **learning, consistency, and revision**.  
It also helps me track my progress as I grow as a web developer.

## Repository Structure

This repository documents my daily JavaScript learning progress. I create a new folder each day following the naming convention:

- `js101/`
- `js102/`
- `js103/`
- `js104/` (and so on...)

Each folder contains practice exercises and concepts I'm working through. I'll continue this pattern until I've understand all JavaScript fundamentals and advanced topics.

## About This Repository

While this repo is currently focused on JavaScript, it also contains my earlier work on **HTML and CSS** (see the `zerodha-clone` folder). As I continue learning, I plan to expand this repository to include practice projects and exercises for other programming languages and technologies.

**Current Focus:** JavaScript fundamentals and advanced concepts

## Learning Resources

I use multiple AI assistants to generate progressive practice questions:

1. **ChatGPT** - For concept explanations and exercises
2. **Mistral** (via Ollama) - For additional practice problems

These tools provide me with questions in three difficulty levels:

- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

This approach helps me build a strong foundation before moving to more complex topics.

## Goal

To gain a comprehensive understanding of JavaScript through consistent daily practice and hands-on problem-solving.
